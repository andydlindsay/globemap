## Map Data Across the Globe
### Part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum

### User Stories
- I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.
- I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.
- I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.
